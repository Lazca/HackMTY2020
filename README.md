# CoSMaS
Repositorio para el codigo de UltimateLlamas HackMTY 2020

## Inspiration
Living through Covid crisis social distancing is crucial, however for businesses like restaurants can not afford prolonged time without giving service.

## What it does
Our tool helps to dynamically adjust to new social distancing standards, proposing a hexagonal arrangement since its is the most efficient tiling on a 2D plane.

## How we built it
It is completely built using python in conjunction with the library PySimpleGUI for graphic elements.

## Challenges I ran into
The design process to achieve our goals was quite though since at the beginning it was not clear how to solve the problem.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are really proud on all the work put through the hack, the end product was quite mesmerizing since for us it was our first full stack project using python.

## What I learned
We learn some algorithms on space partitioning like Quadtree, BSP, also properties on tiling regular shapes, and building gui's

## What's next for CoSMaS
We have been thinking about improving graphic elements, make it a web app, adding more features for user reservation.
